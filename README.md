## Project Overview

Sales and customer engagement for an automobile company show fluctuating patterns, with significant peaks in November and December 2018 and 2019. These months are crucial for both sales and customer activity, but consistency remains a challenge. This project aims to address these challenges by performing an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on automobile sales data to segment customers and enhance marketing strategies.

---

## Main Objective

The goal of this project is to identify high-value clients by segmenting customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary values. Insights from this analysis will help improve customer retention, enhance marketing strategies, and boost overall sales.

---

## Specific Objectives

1. **Customer & Transaction Overview**: Analyze the total number of customers, transactions, sales, and average values for recency, frequency, and monetary metrics.
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Identify which customer segments contribute the most to total sales.
3. **Product Analysis**: Examine which product categories generate the highest sales and identify top-performing items within each segment.
4. **Deal Size Analysis**: Explore how deal size correlates with total sales.
5. **Sales Trends**: Identify trends in sales and customer activity over time.

---

## Data Understanding

The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ddosad/auto-sales-data/data), focuses on automobile sales, covering transactions from 2018 to 2020. It includes customer demographics, transaction details, and product information.

- **Transactions**: 2,747 transaction records.
- **Columns**: 20 columns (includes order details, customer information, product categories).
- **Products**: Motorcycles, classic cars, vintage cars, trucks & buses, trains, ships, and planes.

---

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Removing Duplicates**: No duplicate data found.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: No missing data found.
3. **Data Type Conversion**: 
   - Converted `ORDERNUMBER` from string to integer.
   - Converted `ORDERDATE` from string to date format.
4. **Error Detection**: 
   - Formatted phone numbers.
   - Cleaned non-alphabetical characters.
5. **Profit Calculation**: 
   - Added a "Profit" column: `Profit = Sales â€“ (Quantity Ordered * MSRP)`.
6. **Outlier Detection**: No extreme outliers found.
7. **RFM Transformation**: Created 9 customer segments based on RFM analysis.
8. **Exporting Data**: Saved cleaned data in CSV format for use in dashboards.
